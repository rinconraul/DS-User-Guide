# DesignSafe Data Depot

The <a href="https://www.designsafe-ci.org/data/browser/public/" target="_blank">Data Depot</a> is the data repository for DesignSafe. The web interface to the Data Depot allows you to browse, upload, download, share, curate and publish data stored within the repository. You are encouraged to use the Data Depot not only for curation and publication of research results, but as a working "scratch" area for any of your own data and work in progress. Scientific applications in the <a href="https://www.designsafe-ci.org/rw/workspace/" target="_blank">Tools & Applications</a> area can access your Data Depot files, enabling data analysis directly in the DesignSafe portal that minimizes the need to transfer data to your laptop. The Data Depot hosts both public and private data associated with a project, with the following directories:

* **My Data**: Private directory for your data.
* **HPC Work**: Work directory on TACC HPC machines for use with Jupyter.
* **My Projects**: Data to be curated and published must be in this directory. Also has group access that you control.
* **Shared with Me**: DEPRECATED. Use My Projects. Legacy directory we are no longer utilizing, but some very early users may have data. 
* **Box.com**: Access to your Box files for copying to DesignSafe.
* **Dropbox.com**: Access to your Dropbox for copying to DesignSafe.
* **Google Drive**: CURRENTLY NOT FUNCTIONAL. Google has made changes that we are working through to reenable.
* **Published**: Curated data/projects with DOI's.
* **Published (NEES)**: Curated data/projects from NEES program that ran from 1999 - 2015.
* **Community Data**: Non-curated user-contributed data.
