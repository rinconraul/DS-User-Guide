## User Account Registration, Password Reset, and Reactivation

Any natural hazards researcher or practitioner that wants an environment to store, analyze, curate, publish, and discover data with a community of peers may register for an account. [**Request a user account**](https://www.designsafe-ci.org/account/register/), and then follow the instructions in the email you receive to complete setting up your account. You will then be able to [**log in to DesignSafe**](https://www.designsafe-ci.org/). A DesignSafe account is a TACC user account, so you will sometimes see emails from TACC and URLs that take you to the TACC domain tacc.utexas.edu.

To **reset your password**, go to [https://accounts.tacc.utexas.edu/forgot_password](https://accounts.tacc.utexas.edu/forgot_password), enter your username or email address that is associated with your user account, and you will receive an email with a password reset link. 

If you receive an **Authentication Failed** error when logging in, and you are confident that you have entered the correct password for your account, then it is likely that you need to **Reactivate Account** due to your account being Deactivated due to more than 120 days having passed since you last logged in. To reactivate your account, log in at accounts.tacc.utexas.edu and then request an activation link via [https://accounts.tacc.utexas.edu/activate](https://accounts.tacc.utexas.edu/activate). You will receive an email at the email address associated with your user account with instructions for account reactivation.
